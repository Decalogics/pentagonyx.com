                <h2>What I do</h2> <br>
                <p class="normalP">I've made a few little things in my years as a teenager with disposable income and
                    unlimited free time.<br><br>
                    Albeit kind of simple- I've made a few funny images, videos, and even some (simple) games!<br><br>
                    Here's some of the things I've made.</p><br>

                    <h5>"Evangeladum"</h5>
                    <p class="normalP">A parody of the opening to "Neon Genesis Evangelion", this was made for a
                        streamer named <a href="https://4ctheblack.com">AdumAdumAdum</a>.<br>(Name so nice you say it
                        thrice!).<br><br>
                        This was an ambitious project for me, as it was my first time really editing anything.<br><br>
                        Like the original, it features many different plot-significant images flashing on screen to
                        funky music. These are all in-jokes or memes that we made- or people relevant to the
                        streams.<br><br>
                        Any peoples depicted, living or dead, are purely coincidental.<br><br></p>

                <h2>Images with Friday Night Funkin' Music</h2> <br>
                <p class="normalP">Images with Friday Night Funkin' Music was a Twitter account I made in early 2021. It
                    was what some would call a "gimmick account"- a Twitter account that, as the name implies, has a
                    gimmick that they stick to.<br><br>
                    "Friday Night Funkin'" was a free rhythm game that gained popularity in late 2020-2021. It sparked
                    lots of fan-content- and I thought the game was pretty cool, so I made a gimmick account for
                    it.<br><br>
                    My first post was immediately retweeted by the main developer of the game (Who I beat in Smash
                    Ultimate twice, by the way), and that got my account on the track to gaining tons of
                    followers.<br><br>
                    I kept it up for a while- and even hired someone to post in my place sometimes.<br><br>
                    Eventually, it amassed over 8,400 followers. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I decided "Man, I can't do
                    this forever." and shut it down in the summer of that year.<br><br>
                    Most of the posts are lost to time- and none of them have survived except for the first ever post.
